# A Random map generator for Supreme Commander Forged Alliance.

I wrote this code around 2014, and it has not been updated since then.  The code isn't the cleanest, but I did manage to generate some decent maps with it.
It's original home on BitBucket has long since disappeared, so I am placing it on GitHub for others to use as a reference.

This project is **not** actively maintained.
