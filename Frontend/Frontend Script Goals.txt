The goals of the frontend script is to:

1. Select a random seed for use in GeoGen and the Map Generator application

2. Execute GeoGen with appropriate parameters to create a playable heightmap
   (Ideally, this will also involve randomly selecting a map template)

3. With output from step 2, execute the Map Generation program with 
   appropriate parameters to create a playable Supreme Commander map

4. Place the finished map in the appropriate location for use with FA

NOTE: The batch files in this folder are included as examples to build upon.
